*There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

*A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

14887		  I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
		      Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
16371		  I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

*Annabel recognized the killer from her gym. I want to see if she worked out at Get Fit Now Gym on January the 9th.

67318		I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
			  She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
			
*Joe was not interviewed for some reason. It seems that Jeremey admitted to something here so now I'll look at license records to try and find this lady.
